### `daily LLM cap reached for mailbox <mailboxId>: <cap> calls since <dayStart> (America/Los_Angeles day); mail waits until <time>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, `[triage]` worker. One warning per mailbox and quota day, per process (a restart logs it again).
- **Cause:** The mailbox used `LLM_DAILY_CAP` LLM call attempts (`audit_log` event `llm.call`, failed calls too) since the start of the Pacific day.
- **Fix:** No action needed. The mail goes back to `pending` and waits until the next quota day. If it fires too early, check failed `llm.call` rows (503 retries count) and read `notes/2026-11-05-gemini-free-tier-triage.md`. Change `LLM_DAILY_CAP` only with the real RPD.
- **Status:** won't fix (expected behaviour)

### `LLM soft error <code>: triage paused for <n> min, until <time>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/pause.ts` (`[triage]`). Codes: `http_429`, `http_500`, `http_502`, `http_503`, `http_504`, `timeout`.
- **Cause:** Google quota or overload (the model, not the mail). The LLM client of the process pauses with a backoff of 5 → 60 min, in memory.
- **Fix:** Wait. The mail goes back to `pending` with `next_attempt_at` = the pause end and no try count. A restart clears the pause. Often seen with `gemini-3.8-flash` (503) and on Flash-Lite at busy times (`notes/2026-11-05-gemini-free-tier-triage.md`).
- **Status:** workaround

### `LLM config error <code>: check GEMINI_API_KEY, GEMINI_MODEL_CLASSIFIER and the Google project (billing, region); triage paused for <n> min, until <time>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/pause.ts` (`[triage]`). Codes: `http_401`, `http_402`, `http_403`, `http_404`, `http_400_key`, `http_400_precondition`.
- **Cause:** A bad or missing key, no access or billing, a wrong region, or an unknown model name. Retrying the mail does not help.
- **Fix:** Check `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL_CLASSIFIER` and the Google project. Then restart the server. The pause uses the same backoff as a soft error and the mail gets no try count.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `triage <mailboxId>: no mailbox_settings row, mailbox skipped`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, `[triage]` worker. One warning per mailbox and process.
- **Cause:** The mailbox has no `mailbox_settings` row, so the worker has no mode, tool switches or category policy for it.
- **Fix:** Create the settings row for the mailbox (default settings). Restart to log the line again. The worker skips the mailbox until the row exists.
- **Status:** workaround

### `triage <mailboxId> failed: <Class> <code>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, error handler of one mailbox. `<Class> <code>` comes from `describeError`: the class name, then the `code` if the error has one (no brackets), never the message text.
- **Cause:** An error outside the LLM call: thread read, save, DB or a bug. It stopped this mailbox for this run.
- **Fix:** The mail in work counts one try and waits 5 minutes. At 3 tries it ends as `unsure` / `triage_error`. Later claimed mail goes back with no count. Look at the class and code, then at the DB and server logs.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `triage failed: <Class> <code>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, outer handler of the run (for example the mailbox list failed).
- **Cause:** An error outside the per-mailbox handler, for example in `listSyncTargets` or the DB connection.
- **Fix:** The next run tries again. If it repeats, check the DB connection and the server log.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `triage <emailId>: lost the claim`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/service.ts`, `[triage]`, on save of a triaged or skipped (`too_old`) mail. Warning.
- **Cause:** The `locked_at` of the mail changed during the work: a stale take-back by a later run (claim older than 5 min), or a slow LLM call. The save did nothing.
- **Fix:** No action. The run that holds the claim triages the mail. If it repeats often, check for two servers on one DB or very slow LLM calls.
- **Status:** won't fix (expected behaviour)

### `triage <mailboxId>: release failed: <Class> <code>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, when it puts claimed mail back to `pending`.
- **Cause:** The DB update failed (connection or lock). The mail stays `processing` with its claim.
- **Fix:** The mail becomes claimable after 5 minutes (stale claim). That take-back counts one attempt. Check the DB.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `triage <mailboxId>: triage_error save failed: <Class> <code>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/jobs.ts`, when the third hard error should save `unsure` / `triage_error`.
- **Cause:** The DB write of the `triage_error` result failed.
- **Fix:** The code releases the mail with a 5-minute wait and a count. It tries again later. Check the DB.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `triage <emailId>: llm.call audit write failed: <Class> <code>`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-05
- **Source:** `apps/server/src/modules/triage/service.ts`, after a failed LLM call. Warning.
- **Cause:** The `audit_log` row for the failed call could not be written. The error rules still run, but the call is missing from the daily cap count.
- **Fix:** Check the DB. The cap may count too few calls until it works.
- **Status:** investigating (per case)

### `Failed to copyto: failed to HEAD for download: Unknown 401`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-03
- **Source:** `deploy/backup.sh` on the VPS, `rclone copyto` to the B2 bucket.
- **Cause:** the B2 key can only write. Before the upload, rclone sends a HEAD request to check the target file, and B2 refuses it.
  The apt rclone (1.53) fails earlier; the VPS uses rclone 1.75.2 at `~/bin/rclone`.
- **Fix:** `rclone copyto --no-check-dest` in `deploy/backup.sh`. Cron `PATH` starts with `/home/serwer/bin` (`notes/2026-11-03-pilot-vps.md`).
- **Status:** fixed

### `sync <mailbox id> failed: invalid input syntax for type bigint: "NaN"`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-03
- **Source:** `[mail]` sync job, first sync of the Interia mailbox.
- **Cause:** Interia sends no `UIDNEXT` in the SELECT reply. `inboxStatus()` returned `NaN`, and the cursor update failed in Postgres.
- **Fix:** `inboxStatus()` in `apps/server/src/modules/mail/imap/client.ts` asks `STATUS (UIDNEXT)`, then uses the highest UID + 1, then 1.
  A missing `UIDVALIDITY` now gives `IMAP INBOX gave no valid UIDVALIDITY`.
- **Status:** fixed

### `This model is currently experiencing high demand. Spikes in demand are usually temporary. Please try again later.`

- **First seen:** 2026-11-02
- **Source:** Gemini API, `cd backend && bun run gemini:test` (model `gemini-3.8-flash`, free tier). HTTP 503, status `UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Cause:** Google-side overload of the model. Not a key or config error (the key was accepted). One call hung for more than 90 s before the error.
- **Fix:** retry later. In the app: `platform/llm.ts` treats 503 as a soft error (wait with backoff, no count toward the 3 tries) and uses a 30 s timeout (ADR 0012). Optional fallback model in config.
- **Status:** workaround
- **Update 2026-11-05:** the script is now `apps/server/src/scripts/gemini-check.ts`. Run `bun run gemini:test` from the repo root. It prints `Request failed: LlmSoftError http_503` (no raw body). In the worker, a 503 pauses the LLM client 5 → 60 min (architecture §4.1 rule 7).
